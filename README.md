# ðŸŒ± Garden

Omni Garden specification and visualizer app.

For a reference implementation, check out the [Omniverse](https://github.com/omnidotdev/verse).

## Why "Garden"?

*Cultivation*. A garden is a place where plants are grown and cultivated, and one's ecosystem thrives on this same approach.

## Features

- A visual representation of an ecosystem of projects and their relationships
- Composable: point to a garden spec, load it into a node as a "sub-garden"

## Local Development (Web App)

The app is a landing page and visualizer for Garden schemas. `cd app`, then continue below.

### Building and Running

```sh
bun install
```

```sh
bun run dev
```

## Inspiration

Garden is inspired by the [CNCF Landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io) project, which is a collection of projects that are part of the [CNCF](https://cncf.io). The CNCF Landscape is a visual representation of the projects and their relationships, making it easier to understand the relationships between projects and the larger ecosystem.
